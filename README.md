# Booking System

This project implements a booking system that allows users to reserve services for specific dates and times. Users can
choose a service, specify a desired date, and book a time slot for a specified duration (e.g., booking a service on
10.10.2024 from 13:00 for 1 hour).

This project is composed of multiple microservices that work together to implement a booking system. It
leverages the **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and **Event Sourcing** patterns. The
**Event Sourcing**
pattern and its associated log are used to control concurrent bookings for the same date and time by multiple users,
ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts.

When designing the application, I assumed that the booking system would be a part of a larger application. As a result,
the user is responsible for directly providing the client IDs. This design assumes that the client is trustworthy and
will provide accurate information.

Currently, the user IDs are assumed to be 24-byte hexadecimal strings, similar to MongoDBâ€™s ObjectId. However, this can
be easily changed (with some manual effort) if necessary.

## How to Try Out the App

To quickly get started with the app, follow the steps below:

1. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Follow the instructions in the [Docker Compose section](#docker-compose) to set up the application locally with
   docker.

2. **Explore the API with Swagger UI**  
   Visit [Swagger UI](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mat-sik/booking-system/refs/heads/main/booking-service/api-docs.yaml)
   to interact with the app's API. The API documentation is automatically pulled from the `api-docs.yaml` file hosted on
   my GitHub repository.

**CORS Configuration**  
The app is configured with CORS to allow seamless integration with Swagger UI, so you can test the API directly from the
Swagger interface.

## Request Types

### Command Requests

Command requests are used to modify the state of the MongoDB datastore. In other words, they are responsible for
creating and deleting bookings.

### Query Requests

Query requests are used to retrieve the current state of the MongoDB datastore. They provide users with a point in time
view of available and booked time slots. This view might be stale the moment it is viewed by users.

## Command Service

The **Command Service** consumes records from **Kafka** Topic Partitions, with each partition acting as a
**Event Sourcing**
log, serving as the authoritative source of truth for the application. This log preserves the chronological order of
booking commands, which is essential for ensuring fairness and consistency. By maintaining this order, it prevents race
conditions and conflicts between concurrent booking requests.

As the records are processed, the **Command Service** updates the state representation in **MongoDB**, creating
queryable data view for interested parties.

### Topic Partitioning

The partition key is constructed using the date in **ISO-8601** format and the service ID, represented as a
**MongoDB ObjectId**. By concatenating these two fields, the system ensures that bookings for the same service and date
are routed to the same partition. This approach maintains the chronological order of bookings for a specific service on
a given date, allowing the system to reliably determine which user successfully booked the service first.

This partition key also enables seamless scaling of processing. The processing speed is primarily influenced by the
number of bookings for a specific date and service. Since only the first records are relevant (for example, in the case
of 1,000,000 requests and only 1,000 time slots, we only care about processing the 1,000), performance should remain
strong even under the worst-case scenario.

## Query Service

The **Query Service** allows users to see their bookings. This serves as a way for checking whether a given booking
request was successful.

The service is also used for providing the users with information which bookings are currently not booked. This
information might very quickly become stale, but this is acceptable.

The **Booking Service** interacts with **Query Service** to perform users query requests.

### Swagger API Documentation

The **Query Service** API is fully documented using Swagger. You can explore the available endpoints, their parameters,
and responses directly in the Swagger UI. This provides an interactive interface to test the API and understand the
request/response structures.

## MongoDB data model

`service_bookings Collection`

```json
{
  "_id": "objectid",
  "date": "string",
  "serviceId": "objectid",
  "bookings": [
    {
      "_id": "objectid",
      "userId": "objectid",
      "start": "int32",
      "end": "int32"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `date` field represents the date in the format: **ISO-8601** the same one as in the **Kafka** partition key.

The field In combination with the`serviceId` field, uniquely identifies a list of bookings of a services for a
single day.

The `bookings` field contains a list with objects representing all present bookings.

The `start` and `end` fields have type int32, representing the number of minutes from the 00:00.

## Command Requests

All requests are designed with independence in mind, ensuring consistency by leveraging the at-least-once delivery
guarantee.

### Inserting new booking

To fulfill the request of creating a new booking, the availability of the booking needs to be checked.

Given input parameters:

- `date`- **ISO-8601**
- `serviceId` - id of the servcie for the booking
- `start`- start time of the booking
- `end`  - end time of the booking
- `userId` - id of the user issuing the booking
- `_id` - new objectid of the booking.

First check if a document for a given `date` and `serviceId` already exists, if it does, do nothing, else create new
document with empty `bookings` list.

For document matching `date` and `serviceId`

For every `booking` : `bookings`

Check `input.start < booking.end && input.end > booking.start`

This condition allows for overlapping time ranges, but ranges with the same start and end time (e.g.,
`start: 660, end: 660`) should be ignored. While we could use the condition
`input.start <= booking.end && input.end >= booking.start`, it would require using ranges like `600-660`, `661-761`,
etc., which would introduce unnecessary gaps between adjacent ranges. The current condition allows for adjacent time
slots such as `540-600`, `600-660`, `660-720` without the need for these gaps.

If none is found, push the input object into `bookings` array.

**Implementation**:

```
const newBooking = {
  _id: new ObjectId(),
  userId: new ObjectId(),
  start: 600,
  end: 660,
};

db.service_bookings.updateOne(
  { 
    "date": "03/12/2024", 
    "serviceId": ObjectId("your-service-id") 
  }, 
  { 
    "$setOnInsert": { 
      "date": "03/12/2024", 
      "serviceId": ObjectId("your-service-id"), 
      "bookings": [] 
    } 
  }, 
  { upsert: true }
)

db.service_bookings.updateOne(
  {
    date: "03/12/2024",
    serviceId: ObjectId("your-service-id"),
    $expr: {
      $not: {
        $anyElementTrue: {
          $map: {
            input: "$bookings",
            in: {
              $and: [
                { $lt: [newBooking.start, "$$this.end"] },
                { $gt: [newBooking.end, "$$this.start"] },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    $push: { bookings: newBooking },
  }
);
```

For the best performance, `date` and `serviceId` fields should be used in a composite index, to allow fast fetching of
the documents.

The check for overlap of bookings will be performed in memory. There won't be that many bookings in a single day, so
it is acceptable.

Unfortunately, two queries are required because the `upsert` operation does not work with `$expr` within the same query.
This results in a performance hit compared to using a single query. Additionally, this approach could introduce
concurrency issues if we didn't ensure that all records for a given day are stored on the same log.

For example, consider user A, whose first query creates a new document. If user A loses their time slice in the
meantime, user B could run both queries successfully, effectively booking the service before user A. Although user A was
technically first, he would not successfully book the service.

In practice, this scenario is invisible to the users, so it is not a significant concern.

### Deleting an existing booking

Deleting a booking is simpler than inserting one because there is no need to check for conflicts.

The parameters for `date`, `serviceId` and `_id` of the booking are needed.

```
const bookingIdToDelete = new ObjectId("booking-id-to-delete");

db.service_bookings.updateOne(
  {
    date: "03/12/2024",
    serviceId: ObjectId("your-service-id"),
  },
  {
    $pull: { bookings: { _id: ObjectId("your-booking-id") } }
  }
);
```

### Updating an existing booking

To fulfill this requirement, the booking should first be deleted, and then a new booking should be created. However,
there is no guarantee that the creation will succeed.

## Query Requests

### Get information about a single booking

Query:

```
db.service_bookings.aggregate([
{
    $match: {
        date: "03/12/2024",
        serviceId: ObjectId("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
    }
},
{
    $unwind: "$bookings"
},
{
    $project: {
        _id: "$bookings._id",
        userId: "$bookings.userId",
        start: "$bookings.start",
        end: "$bookings.end"
   }
},
{
    $match: {
        "_id": ObjectId("67500fcd910fab08c24c4ac1")
    }
},
{
    $project: {
        _id: 0 
   }
}
]);
```

Output:

```
[
  {
    userId: ObjectId('bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'),
    start: 540,
    end: 600
  }
]
```

### Get all bookings of a list of users for a list of dates and a list of services

This query usually is used with multiple dates, single serviceId and single userId.

But additional functionality might prove useful when extending the application.

Query:

```
db.service_bookings.find(
{
    date: {
        $in: ["03/12/2024", "04/12/2024"] 
    },
    serviceId: {
        $in: [ObjectId("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")]
    }
},
{
   date: 1,
   serviceId: 1,
   bookings: {
       $filter: {
           input: "$bookings",
           cond: {
                $in: ["$$this.userId", [ObjectId("bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb")]]
           }    
       }  
   } 
}
);
```

Output:

```
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('67500fbf03727dde1663113a'),
    date: '03/12/2024',
    serviceId: ObjectId('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'),
    bookings: [
      {
        _id: ObjectId('67500fcd910fab08c24c4ac1'),
        userId: ObjectId('bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'),
        start: 540,
        end: 600
      },
      {
        _id: ObjectId('67501009d8dd2b769e43560c'),
        userId: ObjectId('bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'),
        start: 600,
        end: 660
      },
      {
        _id: ObjectId('6750101e3f68f50a6bcd7b58'),
        userId: ObjectId('bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'),
        start: 660,
        end: 720
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('6750348003727dde1663113b'),
    serviceId: ObjectId('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'),
    date: '04/12/2024',
    bookings: []
  }
]
```

### Get all available time ranges with a specified length and skip for a given day and a service

To fulfill this request, the query should retrieve all booking time ranges for a specified date and service.

The rest is calculated in memory.

Query:

```
db.service_bookings.aggregate([
{
    $match: {
        date: "03/12/2024",
        serviceId: ObjectId("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
    }
},
{
    $unwind: "$bookings"
},
{
    $project: {
        "_id": 0,
        start: "$bookings.start",
        end: "$bookings.end"
   }
}
]);
```

Output:

```
[
  { start: 540, end: 600 },
  { start: 600, end: 660 },
  { start: 660, end: 720 },
  { start: 720, end: 780 }
]
```

## Helper Modules

To streamline the integration of microservices, I created several helper modules:

### `commons-models`

This module defines common data models for bookings, providing a standardized structure that is shared across the
system.

### `commons-json`

This module includes common Jackson configurations and classes that represent API responses. The response classes are
used, for example, in the **Query Service** and **Booking Service** to ensure consistent response structures.

### `commons-kafka`

This module, like `commons-json`, provides shared Kafka configurations and defines classes for Kafka message values. It
ensures consistent Kafka message formats and configurations across the **Command Service** and **Booking Service**.

## **Docker**

### Prerequisites

#### Helper Modules

Before building the Docker images, ensure that the common modules are installed by running the following command:

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Note:**

- You must be in the directory of the module when running the command.
- The resulting JAR files will be used during the Docker image build process.
- It is assumed that the JAR files will be located in the `/target` directory of the respective modules.

#### `.env` files

When deploying your application using Docker Compose, configure the following environment variables:

##### For deploying everything with Docker Compose

```
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_HOST=booking-system-mongo
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_LOGIN=admin
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_PASSWORD=pass
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_AUTH_DB=admin
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_DB=booking-system-db

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=booking-system-kafka:9092

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_COMMAND_SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=command-consumer
BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_COMMAND_SERVICE_GROUP_ID=command-consumers

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_BOOKING_SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=command-consumer

BOOKING_SYSTEM_QUERY_SERVICE_URL=http://booking-system-query-service:8080
```

**Notes**:

- The hostnames (`booking-system-mongo`, `booking-system-kafka`, `booking-system-query-service`) correspond to the
  service names defined in your Docker Compose file.

##### for java apps running on host

To configure the Java apps running on your host, set the following environment variables:

```
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_HOST=localhost
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_LOGIN=admin
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_PASSWORD=pass
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_AUTH_DB=admin
BOOKING_SYSTEM_MONGO_DB=booking-system-db

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_COMMAND_SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=command-consumer
BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_COMMAND_SERVICE_GROUP_ID=command-consumers

BOOKING_SYSTEM_KAFKA_BOOKING_SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=command-consumer

BOOKING_SYSTEM_QUERY_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8081
```

**Notes**:

- When running the apps on your host, you need to pass the `.env` file by configuring the IntelliJ run configuration.
- In the IntelliJ run configuration, set the query service's port to a value other than 8080 to avoid conflicts with the
  booking service. For example, use `--server.port=8081`.

### Building **Docker** images

Execute the following commands from the root directory of the repository to build each service's Docker image:

#### Query Service

```shell
docker build -f ./query-service/Dockerfile . -t query-service
```

#### Booking Service

```shell
docker build -f ./booking-service/Dockerfile . -t booking-service
```

#### Command Service

```shell
docker build -f ./command-service/Dockerfile . -t command -service
```

Once the common modules are installed and available, you can use standard Docker Compose commands to manage the
services. For example:

### **Docker Compose**

All required services can be started seamlessly using Docker Compose.

#### Setup Instructions:

1. Ensure that you have an `.env` file created in the same directory as `docker-compose.yaml`.
2. If image building is necessary:
    - Compile the common modules and ensure their JAR files are available beforehand.
    - These JAR files are essential for successfully building the Docker images.

For help with prerequisites, refer to [this](#prerequisites).

## Testing

I have thoroughly tested the repositories using *Testcontainers* to ensure proper database interaction. Additionally, I
have fully tested the controllers by utilizing Spring's mock HTTP capabilities. I also tested the functionality for
returning non-occupied time ranges.

All tests are parameterized to maximize the ease of writing new test cases and reduce code duplication.

### Note about **Testcontainers** and **Colima**

When using **Colima** on a **MacOS** system, **Testcontainers** requires the local **Docker** environment to be properly
discovered. To enable this, you need to set the following environment variables in your shell:

```shell
export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://${HOME}/.colima/docker.sock"
```
